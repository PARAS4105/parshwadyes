            "discription": "Direct dyes are another class of dyes, one of the two types of dyes that are mixed in 'all purpose' dyes such as Rit. (The other type in the mixture is an acid dye, which will not stay in any cellulose fiber for long.) The colours of direct dyes are duller than those provided by fiber reactive dyes, and the washfastness is poor - expect anything dyed with them to 'bleed' forever. The one advantage is that direct dyes may be more lightfast, that is, resistant to fading in the light, than fiber reactive dyes. The \"direct dye\" classification in the Colour Index system refers to various planar, highly conjugated molecular structures that also contain one or more anionic sulfonate group. It is because of these sulfonate groups that the molecules are soluble in water. Though most direct dyes still can be obtained in powder form, it is increasingly popular to receive them as liquid concentrates. The advantage of concentrates is that they are easy to handle and meter. The disadvantage is that the surfactants and co-solvents needed to keep the dye concentrates stable may interfere with retention and sizing in the case of very deeply coloured grades. <br><br> Direct dyes are used on cellulose fibers such as cotton, rayon, and linen. They lack the permanence of the cold water fiber reactive dyes which most serious dyers prefer for use on cellulose fibers, but in some cases they have advantages that make their use worthwhile. For example, while many of the direct dyes are not very lightfast, there are some dyes in the class that may be more lightfast than similar shades of fiber reactive dyes. All direct dyes perform rather poorly with respect to washfastness. Without an appropriate after-treatment, direct dyes bleed a little with every washing, losing their brightness and endangering other clothes washed in the same load. However, there are special after-treatments which may be used to solve this problem. (Vinegar is not among them! In spite of claims you may see to the contrary, you cannot use vinegar to set any dye on cotton or other cellulose materials.) A product called Retayne, which is an ionic bulking agent which essentially \"glues\" the dye into the fiber, works very well to make fabric dyed with direct dyes washable without bleeding of the dye.<br><br> The name 'direct dye' alludes to the fact that these dyes do not require any form of 'fixing'. They are almost always azo dyes, with some similarities to acid dyes. They also have sulphonate functionality, but in this case, it is only to improve solubility, as the negative charges on dye and fibre will repel each other. Their flat shape and their length enable them to lie along-side cellulose fibres and maximize the Van-der-Waals, dipole and hydrogen bonds. Below is a diagram of a typical direct dye. Note that the sulphonate groups are spread evenly along the molecule on the opposite side to the hydrogen bonding -OH groups, to minimize any repulsive effects.<br><br> ",

It's difficult now to find out which specific acid dyes fall into which of these dye classes, however. At least part of the reason is that the information is not particularly useful to the dyer.<br><br> Most histologic dyes are classified either as acid or as basic dyes. An acid dye exists as an anion (negatively charged) in solution, while a basic dye exists as a cation (positive charge). For instance, in the hematoxylin-eosin stain (H&E), the hematoxylin-metal complex acts as a basic dye. The eosin acts as an acid dye. A very large class of dyes containing acidic groups, such as the sodium salts of sulfonic acids or phenolic groups. They are more soluble and have less tinctorial value than basic dyes but they also have greater light fastness. They do not form lakes with tannin. Acid dyes are used in dyeing leather, paper, etc., and their particular value lies in their ability to produce brighter, more uniform colours. They are normally applied from an acid dye liquor (acetic, formic, or sulphuric acid); however, unless applied from a neutral or only slightly acid dyebath, i.e., pH of 6.0 to 7.0, their use is likely to result in acid degradation of the material dyed.<br><br>"

Their molecules are typically nonpolar or little polar, and they do not undergo ionization. They are insoluble in water. <br><br> Names of solvent dyes are often generic, of the scheme \"solvent\", eg. Solvent Red 24, Solvent Red 26, Solvent Red 164, Solvent Yellow 124, Solvent Blue 35, etc.<br><br> Red and yellow solvent dyes are often azo dyes, green and blue ones tend to be anthraquinone dyes.<br><br>",

Accordingly, oil solvent dyes are often used in the automotive industry to color petrol fuel and other hydrocarbon based fuel oils. Oil can be colored by oil soluble dyes.In addition, many solvent dyes are used as components by the biological stain manufacturing community to produce stains that will identify various cell structure components in medical diagnostics and scientific research.<br><br> Oil soluble solvent dyes have better temperature stability in engineering plastics, very high brightness and do result in completely transparent plastics without any haze and light scattering. Processing is easy and process parameters like viscosity remain unaffected. Process conditions for engineering plastics like polystyrene, ABS, PC, PMMA, PA and others are quite severe. During extrusion and injection moulding of PC the dyes have to withstand temperatures up to over 350°C for some minutes. Only selected oil solvent dyes do show the needed chemical resistance. Chemical stability also leads to long lasting final products which have to withstand sunlight and weather. As an example red car taillights will last as long as the car itself without loosing the bright red colour. To achieve this, the right transparent polymers and right dyes have to be taken.<br><br> Commodity polymers like Polyethylene, polypropylene, plasticized PVC or rubber are soft at low temperatures. we do not recommend any solvent dyes for coloration of these polymers but pigments have to be used.<br><br> Besides plastics industry, a major application for solvent dyes is printing or solvent based writing ink. Furthermore, oil soluble dyes are widely used in rubbers, oil inks, spinning, waxes, smoke, paints, color paste, transfer printing, marking pens, ball point pens, candles, oil, fats, solvents, bitumen, lubricants, marking inks, inkjet printing inks, dye sublimation printing, glass coloration, signaling smoke, firework and in the pyrotechnics industries, gold imitation, other transparent metallic effects of metallized polyester films, other hydrocarbon-based nonpolar materials.<br><br>",
